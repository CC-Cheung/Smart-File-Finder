# Smart-File-Finder

The Smart-File-Finder is CLI app that smartly navigates file systems based on a description of the desired file/folder. It uses a fine-tuned LLM to predict and open the most likely next folder.

## Project Structure

- `model training/` — Scripts and resources to train the selection model.

## Quick Start
